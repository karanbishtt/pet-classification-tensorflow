# Pet / Animal Classification using TensorFlow

This project implements an **image classification system** that identifies different pets and animals using **TensorFlow** and **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**.

The project is developed as a hands-on deep learning exercise to understand how image data is processed and used for multi-class classification.

## 📌 Project Overview

Image classification is a fundamental problem in computer vision. In this project, a deep learning model is trained to classify images of pets and animals into their respective categories.

The complete workflow — including dataset loading, image preprocessing, model training, and prediction — is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python  
- TensorFlow  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook  

---

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of images of different pets and animals, organized into separate folders where each folder represents a specific class.

This folder-based structure allows TensorFlow to automatically assign labels during training.

The dataset can be obtained from publicly available sources such as:
- Kaggle – animal or pet image datasets

The dataset is used only for educational and learning purposes.

## ⚙️ Workflow

1. Load and organize the image dataset  
2. Resize and normalize images  
3. Split data into training and validation sets  
4. Build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)  
5. Train the model on image data  
6. Evaluate model performance  
7. Test predictions on sample images
